# BestLeetCode

## What is it?
This is an unofficial FAST(est) C++ solution set to problem sets in LeetCode.com. We hope this repository can help people to write flexible programs.

## Why I create it.
Some of my colleagues spend a lot of time on LeetCode.com either for job seeking or sharpening their skills. I became curious and tried to solve a few problems on it. When my solution runs slower than other solutions, I feel unsatisfied. I tried improving my solution as well as searching for better solutions online. I found people posting meaning less just-working solutions here and there in blogs; lots of solutions are not neat nor fast. So I read through the nice ones, try to optimize them and create better solution for myself. I hope this repository that I am editing can help people write simple or performant code as they wish. Writing readable and elegant solutions are easy for most advanced developers but being flexible enough to find a balance between speed and conciseness is an art.

## Editing plan
I will try to push 1-2 solution per week. 
I will try to make the solutions self explanatory and put alternative solutions below.

Any suggestion/advice/correction are welcome. You can either commit to my repo or email me at <adis@live.cn>. 

## My story
My experience in coding started with MATLAB in college and stayed as a TA for a MATLAB computing technique class for two years. Then I learned python for a graduate school class and taught myself Objective-C because I thought it was interesting to work with iPhone apps. Later I learned many many other different languages and tools however, I have never officially taken a computer science class. Improving programing skills are comparable to training in martial arts; you need experience, skill and intensive practice to stay strong. Among these things, skills are a base to start with and it is indispensible for good programmers. 

My job requires me to create idea prototypes with very little time. Thus, I write tons of code per day to impliment features. I almost have no time to look back at my code/design to think about it and improve my coding skills. I feel this might be the time for me to sharpen my skills while composing this repository with my free time and at the same time create useful content for other programmers who are ambitious and passionate. 

C++ is a not too verbose and is efficient for practicing. And at the same time it is sufficient for demostrating concepts and ideas. I hope you all love this repository, find dream jobs, create amazing work.
